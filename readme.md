# Unofficial Prairie Dev Con API Service

----
## What is Prairie Dev Con?
see [Prairie Dev Con](http://www.prairiedevcon.com)

> Organizations are looking for ways to increase their employeeâ€™s skills while maximizing training and professional development budgets. Over six years ago the first Prairie Developer Conference was held in Regina, Saskatchewan to meet this need. It provided a high quality professional development opportunity locally, without the high costs of travel and accommodation typically associated with remote conferences.

>Our April 11-12, 2016 event in Winnipeg will be the eleventh Prairie Dev Con!

## What is this, then?
This project is an unofficial API Service written in Laravel, to power an unofficial Mobile App because, well, their app isn't done yet.

---
## Who made this?
James Robert Perih, of [Hot Dang Interactive](http://hotdang.ca/). Hot Dang Interactive helps small business achieve their **hot dang!** moment by leveraging technology in interesting ways.

## HowTo
When this goes live, there are a couple of routes of interest:

1. ** */api/timeslots* **
This endpoint lists all timeslots, along with associated Rooms, Speaker, Session info

2. ** */api/timeslots/{timeslot_id}* **
As above, but just the specific timeslot

3. ** */api/sessions* **
List all sessions

4. ** */api/sessions/{session_id}* **
List one specific session

5. ** */api/speakers* **
List all speakers

6. ** */api/speakers/{speaker_id}* **
List one specific speaker

7. ** */api/speakers/company/{company_name}* **
Get all speakers belonging to company name

## No, really.. *HOW*?
Well, you could try a [sample iOS app](https://github.com/hotdang-ca/prairiedevcon2016_ios). You'll need [data](https://hotdang.ca/pdc2016/sampledata.sqlite), though.
